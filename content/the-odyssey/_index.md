> The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems
> attributed to Homer. It is one of the oldest extant works
> of literature still widely read by modern audiences. As
> with the Iliad, the poem is divided into 24 books. It
> follows the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and his
> journey home after the Trojan War. After the war, which
> lasted ten years, his journey lasted for ten additional
> years, during which time he encountered many perils and
> all of his crewmates were killed. In his absence, Odysseus
> was assumed dead, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus
> had to contend with a group of unruly suitors who were
> competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.
